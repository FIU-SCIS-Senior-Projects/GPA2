- Installation of Ubuntu

If not already working with Ubuntu, the OS can be downloaded from http://www.ubuntu.com/download
Create a virtual machine with the downloaded Ubuntu OS. This can be done with specialized software that create virtual machine such as Virtual Box which can be downloaded at: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

-Initialization of Database

Create a table in the local database with the name “GPA_Tracker”. This can be done from mysql in the command line with a command like “CREATE TABLE GPA_Tracker” or with the aid of a GUI like phpmyadmin.
Use ssh to connect to gpa-dev.cis.fiu.edu. Create a mysqldump and transfer the file to your local VM with scp.
Run the command: mysql -u <user> -p GPA_Tracker < <SQLDumpFile> with <user> replaced with user name and <SQLDumpFile> with whatever the SQLDumpFile was named.

-Initialization of Python Tools

From the command line run the following commands:
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential
sudo pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv
sudo pip install PyPDF2

-Android Development Tool
Download Java SDK from: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Download Android Studio from: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

-Installing WebServices
Run the following from the command line:
sudo apt-get install tomcat7
sudo apt-get install tomcat7-admin
At this point check if it works by going to localhost:8080

Create a manager by editing etc/tomcat7/tomcat-users xml with:
Add <role rolename="manager-gui"/> before </tomcat-users>
Add <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/> “ right after. Any value can be used for username and password.
Test by going to localhost:8080/manager and logging in with those credentials.

Install axis2.war from https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/download.cgi. deploy it on the WebServer.
Development for WebServices is done on eclipse which can be downloaded from: https://eclipse.org/downloads/

-Connecting to mySQL using JNDI
Download mySQL connector from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
Determine the location of Catalina Base using ‘grep -r “CATALINA_BASE”’
Move the Download from step one to Catalina_Base/lib where Catalina_Base is whatever directory was in step 2.
Go to the Catalina_Base/config. There should be a resource XML file. Add the following in that XML File inside of <context>:
<Resource
    name="jdbc/GPA_Tracker"
    auth="Container"
    type="javax.sql.DataSource"
    maxActive="100"
    maxIdle="30"
    maxWait="10000"
    driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
    url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/GPA_Tracker"
    username="root"
    password="secret"
    />
The username and password should be the same as in your mySQL.

In the web.xml file insert, before the closing tag:
<resource-ref>
    <description>DB Connection</description>
    <res-ref-name>jdbc/GPA_Tracker</res-ref-name>
    <res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
    <res-auth>Container</res-auth>
</resource-ref>
